<p><br/>NOTE: The text of requirements 6 &amp; 8 above are taken from the <i>Personal Fitness</i> merit badge pamphlet, not the Boy Scout Requirements book.<br/>&nbsp; <br/>The Physical Fitness Tests and Body Composition Evaluation specified for requirements 6 and 8 are as follows:
</p>
	<b>AEROBIC FITNESS TEST</b>
	Record your performance on one of the following tests:
	a. Run/walk as far as you can as fast as you can in nine minutes
	OR
	b. Run/walk one mile as fast as you can.
	
	<b>FLEXIBILITY TEST</b>
	Using a sit-and-reach box constructed according to specifications in the <i>Personal Fitness</i> merit badge pamphlet, make four repetitions and record the fourth reach. This last reach must be held steady for 15 seconds to qualify. (Remember to keep your knees down.)
	
	<b>STRENGTH TESTS</b>
	You must do the sit-ups exercise and one other (either push-ups or pull-ups). You may also do all three for extra experience and benefit.
	a. <b>Sit-ups.</b> Record the number of sit-ups done correctly in 60 seconds. The sit-ups must be done in the form explained and illustrated in the <i>Personal Fitness</i> merit badge pamphlet.
	b. <b>Pull-ups.</b> Record the total number of pull-ups completed correctly in 60 seconds. Be consistent with the procedures presented in the <i>Personal Fitness</i> merit badge pamphlet.
	c. <b>Push-ups.</b> Record the total number of push-ups completed correctly in 60 seconds. Be consistent with the procedures presented in the <i>Personal Fitness</i> merit badge pamphlet.
	
	<b>BODY COMPOSITION EVALUATION</b> (Calculating Your BMI percentile):
	Step 1 - Multiply your weight in pounds by 703.
	Step 2 - Divide the figure you get in No. 1 above by your height in inches.
	Step 3 - Divide the figure you get in No. 2 above by your height in inches to get your BMI.
	Step 4 - Use the chart in the <i>Personal Fitness</i> merit badge pamphlet to determine the BMI percentile for your age.
	As an example, if you are 15 years old, you weigh 130 pounds, and you are 5'8" (68") tall, then:
	1. 130 x 703 = 91390
	2. 91390 / 68 = 1344
	3. 1344 / 68 = 20. This means your BMI is 20.
	4. From the chart in the pamphlet, you are at the 50th percentile.
